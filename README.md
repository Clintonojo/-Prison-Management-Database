Creating Tables:

The code starts by creating a table called Prison with columns like inmate_id, Race, Height, Sex, Eye_Color, Prison_Sentence, CaseID, and FacilityID. This table appears to store information about inmates.
Creating Views:

Two views, Main and Subcat, are created. Views are virtual tables that can be used to simplify queries. Main includes columns from the Prison table, and Subcat includes a subset of columns from the Prison table.
Creating Additional Tables:

Two more tables, CaseTable and Facility, are created. CaseTable seems to store details about criminal cases, and Facility stores information about prison facilities.
Adding Foreign Keys:

Foreign key constraints are added to the Prison table to link it to the CaseTable and Facility tables, establishing relationships between them.
Inserting Data:

Sample data is inserted into the Prison, CaseTable, and Facility tables to populate them.
Dropping Tables:

Commands to drop the Facility, Prison, and CaseTable tables are included. Be cautious with the DROP TABLE command as it permanently deletes tables and their data.
Describing Tables:

The DESCRIBE command is used to display information about the structure of the Prison and CaseTable tables.
Selecting Data:

Various SELECT statements are used to query data from the tables and views, demonstrating how to retrieve specific information.
Updating Data:

UPDATE statements are used to modify records in the Prison table.
Creating Views (Temporary Tables):

Temporary views (RaceSex and HeightEye_Color) are created to simplify data access for specific columns.
Trigger for Juvenile Records:

A trigger named InsertIntoJuvenile is created to automatically insert records into a juvenile table when a new inmate under 18 is added to the Prison table. It calculates the inmate's age and checks if they are under 18 before insertion.
Creating juvenile Table:

The juvenile table is created to store records of juvenile inmates.
Trigger for Female Inmates:

Another trigger named InsertIntoLadyPrison is created to insert records of female inmates into a lady_prison table when new inmates are added to the Prison table. It checks the Sex column for the value 'F' to identify female inmates.
Selecting Data from lady_prison:

A SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from the lady_prison table.
